For this project, you’ll need to use a data structure that’s similar
(but not identical)to a binary tree. For a summary of a few different examples, reference this article.

A knight in chess can move to any square on the standard 8x8 chess board from any
other square on the board, given enough turns (don’t believe it? See this animation).
Its basic move is two steps forward and one step to the side. It can face any direction.
